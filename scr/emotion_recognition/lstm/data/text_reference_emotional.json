  "The Little Prince": "It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye. You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed.",
  "The Handmaid's Tale": "We were never more than women serving men, that is all. We are containers, it's what men want us to be. I am a vessel, a womb, a stomach.",
  "The Wealth of Nations": "It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. Every individual endeavors to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value.",
  "The Declaration of Independence (Chinese translation)": "That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.",
  "The Communist Manifesto": "A spectre is haunting Europe â€” the spectre of communism. The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles. The immediate aim of the Communists is the same as that of all the other proletarian parties: formation of the proletariat into a class, overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy, conquest of political power by the proletariat."
