  "The Little Prince": "What is essential is invisible to the eye. ... 'It is only with the heart that one can see rightly.' ... 'You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed.' ... 'Men have forgotten this truth,' the fox said. 'But you mustn't forget it. You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed.' ... 'It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.'",
  "The Handmaid's Tale": "We were never more than women serving men, that is all. ... We are containers, it's what men want us to be. ... I am a vessel, a womb, a stomach. I am meat, a breed animal, a dairy animal, a work animal. ... I am a thing that thinks. ... I am a woman who could think. I could think and think. And think. But there was no one to tell me what to think with."
  "The Wealth of Nations": "It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. ... Every individual endeavors to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value. ... By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. ... I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good."
  "The Declaration of Independence (Chinese translation)": "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. ... That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. ... That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness."
  "The Communist Manifesto": "A spectre is haunting Europe â€” the spectre of communism. ... The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles. ... The immediate aim of the Communists is the same as that of all the other proletarian parties: formation of the proletariat into a class, overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy, conquest of political power by the proletariat. ... The Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions. Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win. Working men of all countries, unite!"
